# Drone Swarm Simulator

A virtual swarm robotics simulator built using ROS2 and Python that demonstrates autonomous drone control, formation behaviors, and obstacle avoidance.

## Features

- **Dynamic Formations**: Control drones in circle, line, grid, and V-shape formations
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Drones navigate around obstacles
- **Flocking Behavior**: Implementation of Boids algorithm
- **Visual Feedback**: Camera frustum visualization showing each drone's field of view
- **Randomized Environment**: Generate random obstacles for different testing scenarios
